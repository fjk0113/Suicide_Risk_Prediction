Our project aims to detect students who are facing depression. 
This is done by making students to write journals on a daily basis.
This diary notes are entered through the journal app which is developed using flutter.
Our server listens to each note and predicts depression risk percentage using a Deep Learning model developed using Electra Transformer.
Mentors can view students name ordered by their depression risk percentage through another user interface in our Journal app.
